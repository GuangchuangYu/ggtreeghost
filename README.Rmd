## ggtree ghost

just an idea of using `ggghost` to work with `ggtree`.

```r
> tree

Phylogenetic tree with 30 tips and 29 internal nodes.

Tip labels:
	t4, t18, t20, t10, t8, t12, ...

Rooted; includes branch lengths.
> p <- ggtreeghost(tree) + geom_hilight(40)
> code = summary(p, combine=TRUE)
> code
[1] "ggplot(tr, mapping = mapping, layout = layout, mrsd = mrsd, as.Date = as.Date, yscale = yscale, yscale_mapping = yscale_mapping, ladderize = ladderize, right = right, branch.length = branch.length, ndigits = ndigits) + geom_tree(layout = layout, multiPhylo = multiPhylo) + theme_tree() + geom_hilight(40)"
## reproduce the *plot* by running the code text
> eval(parse(text=code))
```

The `tree` will be stored in `attr(p, "data")$data` and with the
`summary(p, combine=TRUE)`, we can output tree and source code to
visualize the tree (in `GGTREE` block) into a `NEXSUS` file.

Then by parsing the output `NEXUS`, we have the `tree` object and the
source code to reproduce tree visualization.

Just
similar to Figtree which can save the *plot* to `NEXUS` tree file. Figtree
introduce a `figtree` block in NEXUS file to store visualization
setting. The idea here is similar.
